Please, output the JSON with the structure shown below. The JSON should assign high-level themes to each of the provided candidate themes.

{
    "<THEME>": ["<CANDIDATE_THEME>", "<CANDIDATE_THEME>", ...],
    "<THEME>": ["<CANDIDATE_THEME>", "<CANDIDATE_THEME>", ...],
    ...
    "Miscellaneous": ["<CANDIDATE_THEME>", "<CANDIDATE_THEME>", ...],
}

Only output valid JSON object with themes as keys and lists of candidate themes as associated values. Nothing else - no explanations, no preface or additional text. Always return a valid JSON object. Each candidate theme will be associated with exactly one theme.
