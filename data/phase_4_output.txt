Please, output the JSON with the structure shown below. The JSON should assign three unique themes to each of the provided data points. The themes should be ordered from the most salient one for that data point to the least.

{
    "<ID>": ["<THEME_1>", "<THEME_2>", "<THEME_3>", "<THEME_4>", "<THEME_5>"],
    "<ID>": ["<THEME_1>", "<THEME_2>", "<THEME_3>", "<THEME_4>", "<THEME_5>"]
    ...
}

Only output valid JSON object with ids as keys and list of themes as associated values. Nothing else - no explanations, no preface or additional text. Always return a valid JSON object; even if only single data point is provided. There will be exactly one key-value pair per data point with the id matching the ID of the data point (string). Specifically, avoid splitting single ID into multiple ones by appending _# suffixes. Simply, always use a single corresonding ID.
