THEMATIC ANALYSIS - PHASE 2: GENERATING INITIAL CODES

RESEARCH CONTEXT
You are performing Phase 2 of a thematic analysis on Czech crime cases for sentencing typology research. The goal is to create behavioral descriptions of modus operandi - how offenders committed their crimes.

ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS FOR PHASE 2
This phase should produce:
- Comprehensive coding of all meaningful data extracts with systematic labels
- Rich, diverse set of codes that capture interesting behavioral features across the dataset
- Semantic-level codes that describe explicit content rather than interpretive themes
- Data-driven codes that emerge from the content, not imposed theoretical frameworks
- Inclusive coding that captures potentially relevant features for later theme development

EXPECTED OUTCOME
- Diverse range of behavioral modus operandi codes (methods, targets, contexts, victim characteristics)
- Systematic coverage ensuring no important behavioral patterns are missed
- Codes that will serve as building blocks for theme development in Phase 3
- Balance between specificity (capturing nuanced differences) and generalizability (allowing pattern recognition)

WHAT TO FOCUS ON WHEN CODING
When analyzing each crime case, focus on:
1. VICTIM AUTONOMY IMPACT: What types of rights were infringed and to what extent
2. METHODS AND MEANS: What specific techniques, tools, or approaches were used
3. OFFENDER MOTIVATION: Deduce the likely motivation or aim (not directly stated)
4. CONSEQUENCES: Impact on victim and society
5. HABITUAL PATTERNS: Whether behavior suggests repeat offending

PHASE 2 CODING INSTRUCTIONS
- Generate initial codes that capture interesting features of the crime data
- Codes should describe the most basic meaningful elements of criminal behavior
- Be systematic and thorough - code for as many potential patterns as possible
- Keep codes specific and descriptive rather than overly general
- Use structured underscore format for systematic coding (e.g., "shoplifting_alcohol", "theft_of_bicycle_from_shared_space")
- Codes should be at a semantic (explicit) level, not interpretive
- Keep codes concise but descriptive (typically 2-5 words connected by underscores)
- Use lowercase with underscores to separate words

MULTIPLE CODES PER CASE - PRESERVING ANALYTIC RICHNESS
Following Braun & Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis and Saldaña's guidance on simultaneous coding:

- **Apply multiple atomic codes per case** to preserve analytic richness (typically 3-4 codes, maximum 5)
- **One idea per code**: Each code should capture a single distinct idea or facet
- **Focus on key facets**: Select the most important behavioral elements rather than coding everything
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have 3-4 precise, meaningful codes than many redundant ones

EXAMPLE OF MULTIPLE CODING (3-4 focused codes)
For a case involving bike theft from locked storage + phone theft from restaurant table:
```json
"initial_codes": [
  "bike_theft_locked_communal_storage",
  "lock_cutting_cable", 
  "phone_theft_unattended_table",
  "serial_offending_multiple_incidents"
]
```

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- BE FACTUALLY CORRECT: Only code what is explicitly described in the case data. Do not make assumptions or add details not present in the text.
- "ONE IDEA PER CODE" APPROACH: Each individual code should focus on a single distinct behavioral element.
- MULTIPLE CODES ENCOURAGED: Apply several codes to capture different facets (method, location, target, security status, etc.)
- Prioritize comprehensive coverage of all meaningful behavioral elements

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS
Below are existing codes from previously analyzed cases. When creating codes:
- Consider reusing existing codes if they accurately capture the criminal behavior
- Maintain consistent naming conventions and structure when possible
- Create new codes when the behavior has meaningful differences from existing patterns
- Balance consistency with capturing the full range of criminal behaviors in the data

NOTE: While consistency is important, don't force cases into inappropriate existing codes. If the criminal behavior has distinct characteristics, create a new appropriate code.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Provide your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    "case_id": ["initial_code_1", "initial_code_2", "initial_code_3"]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY valid JSON - no explanations, no additional text
- Use the exact case ID provided in the data
- Create an ARRAY of 3-5 initial codes per case (aim for 3-4, maximum 5)
- Each code should be a systematic lowercase code with underscores separating words
- Focus on the most important behavioral elements rather than coding every detail
- Examples: ["shoplifting_alcohol", "location_grocery_store", "concealment_in_clothing"]
